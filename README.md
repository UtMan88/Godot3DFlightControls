# Godot3DFlightControls
A template for creating Flight Controls in a 3D scene for Godot!

Follow the complete tutorial here: https://keithmaggio.wordpress.com/2023/10/14/godot-flight-controls-just-the-way-i-like-it/

This project shows how to create a Flight Controller in a similar fashion to Star Fox 64's "All-Range Mode."

This creates a Flight Control Script, a Gameplay "Plane" that moves along its forward (which can be used to switch between All-Range and Rails, if you wanted), a graphical Reticle that follows 3D objects on a 2D canvas, and a Smooth Follow script for the camera.

It also creates a Scene putting all this together, with basic models and a WorldEnvironment with a Skybox. 

Enjoy, and reach out to me on my Blog if you have questions!
